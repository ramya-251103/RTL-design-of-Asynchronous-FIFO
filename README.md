This project presents the RTL (Register-Transfer Level) design and implementation of an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer using Verilog. FIFO buffers are critical in digital systems to manage data flow between asynchronous subsystems with differing clock domains. The asynchronous FIFO architecture used in this project employs separate read and write clocks, which makes it suitable for applications that require efficient handling of data transfers between modules operating at different frequencies. The design includes key components such as a dual-port memory for storage, pointers for tracking the read and write addresses, and control logic for full and empty conditions to avoid data overflow or underflow.
